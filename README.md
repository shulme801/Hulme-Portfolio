## Steve Hulme’s Portfolio — Overview

This portfolio summarizes my
* Experience, goals, aspirations — what I’ve done in a career in information technology and why my passion is full-stack web software development.
* Recent software development projects. They are organized in “reverse chronological” order, from the most recent to the oldest.
	* As I’ve gained experience and skills, the projects have become more complex and use a wider range of tools.
	* Each project features a card with an image and a title. The “vertical ellipsis” to the right of the project title, when clicked, brings up a short overview of the project. Each project’s card also contains
		* A link to the project’s code in my GitHub repo.
		* A link to the deployed project.
* Contact information
	* Name, email, phone number.
	* Link to my resume in PDF format.

## Technologies used for Portfolio
### Materialize
* The portfolio used the Google Materialize framework. I am a fan of Material design.  Google’s framework is a powerful means to implement these design concepts on the Web.
* The CSS for the site consists of
	* The Google Materialize CSS, compiled from its SASS components.
	* My own CSS, also compiled from SASS components. This CSS extends a number of Google’s classes.
### Mobile First Design
* Extensive use of media queries.
* The portfolio’s implementation has been tested with a variety of devices, including
	* iPhone 5
	* iPhone 6
	* iPhone 6s Plus
	* iPad
	* iPad Pro
	* MacBook Air
	* Desktop with 4K monitor.

Testing was done in both portrait and landscape modes on the handheld devices.

In addition, the portfolio was tested with Samsung Galaxy S5 and a Nexus 6P by means of a simulator.

If users experience display issues on another device, please let me know the dimensions and resolution of the screen so that I can correct the media queries.

### Expansion and Development (My To-Do List)
* Add a carousel to display the projects on the Portfolio page.
* Revisit the design of the Contact page to improve its look and feel.
